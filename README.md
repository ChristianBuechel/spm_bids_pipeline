SPM based data import, preprocessing and analyses for data in BIDS format  
Includes a function to download the data from the ISN DICOM data base to the project directory  

THIS IS A MAJOR REVISION, it is very likely that you have adapt your scripts if you have used a previous version


**The data are organized like this:**  
# Organisation  
c:\lcpa - the top data directory  
inside you will get a directory \derivatives  
The data import routine (sbp_import_data.m) will put all images in /derivatives/spm_preprocessing but will also make a  
gzipped copy in the main study directory  
  
You can clone this repository to any directory, but should keep it as is  

**It is best not to edit files inside spm_bids_pipeline**  
  
It is advisable to have a "scripts" directory somewhere where your wrapper functions are located  
In this wrapper function make sure to strat with an   
**addpath(genpath('your_path_2_spm_bids_pipeline'))**

inside derivatives you have spm_preprocessing where all the data goes using \sub-01 etc  
inside sub-01 you have \anat and \func (and \fmap if specified)  

Before you start you need to create a **get_study_specs.m** in your "scripts" folder. There is an example inside the repository "get_study_specs.txt"  
Copy it to "scripts" edit it and rename it to "get_study_specs.m"  

Then you should create a wrapper file such as "do_em_all.m" that will sequentially call the subfunctions in the repository  
There is a commented example in the repo (with ext .txt)

The new version of the toolbox niot only uses a nonlineatr coregistration as in CAT12, but now also incorporates correction with fieldmaps using VDM files. 
Both workflows are described in **do_em_all.txt**

This toolbox now also includes quality control routines found in \qc by Alexandra Tinnermann
See full_diagn_qc.txt for how to call these functions. 

# New features
1) The new version of the toolbox now also incorporates correction with fieldmaps using VDM files.

2) The new version uses an extension to participants.tsv using a column labeled 'scan_id' (the old import still works)
These contain the individual PRISMA numbers. If there are more sessions seperate the PRISMA numbers by spaces NOT tabs !
In addition you can specify series that should NOT be imported by adding them in () with NO space in between e.g.

participant_id	sex	age	scan_id
sub-09	F	20	25879 25878(13)

imports sub-09, with sessions 25879 and 25878. Series 13 in 25878 will be omitted

3) all major functions were now renamed to start with sbp_
4) many new options in sbp_analyses.m
